This addition shows what I want the boids to do. In the game, you traverse obstacles to collect coins and move on to the next level.
This new addition would add an extra challenge to a relatively easy game.
The implemented boids act as a hinderance and annoyance. They fly at you and disrupt you while you are trying to climb around and complete the objective.
This makes the game better and more enjoyable because it gives a challenege for the player to overcome. They are bird shaped to continue with the nature/ outside feel of the game 
so they still fall into place and make sense in the world of this game.
